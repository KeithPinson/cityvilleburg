"""City Name and Sketch Name properties"""
#
# Ideally we would like some sort of hybrid entry field
# that combines display of the sketchname with entry of the
# city name -- this is why the file is named as it is. The
# hybrid entry field would have a different pattern when
# text is being entered than when displayed. For example,
# the city name by itself is displayed during entry and
# allows the user to modify it, but during display the
# sketch name which incorporates the city name is displayed,
# city <==> city1_g1x1. This would be more compact and likely
# more intuitive for the user.
#
# Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be possible in Blender
# as of v2.93, so we are left with using two fields on the
# panel to display city and sketch names. (Incidentally we
# did experiment with one city field and with sketchname
# displayed in the panel header. Less room was taken but
# it was confusing to decipher what was going on.
